With some biology research and competition experience, I entered Pitt as a prospective neuroscience major. I intended to pursue molecular or cellular studies in neurobiology. However, the seed of mathematics and computer science buried in my mind was sprouting secretly as I learned math and Python in my freshman year.

In Summer 2018, I was participating in the [Center for Translational Mental Health Researchâ€™s summer research fellowship](https://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/news/ctmhr-fellows-complete-summer-research-program). While conducting molecular neurobiology experiments, I occasionally learned about computational neuroscience from a colleague studying spike train decoding. I was surprised that math and algorithms can come into neuroscience. That is cool! Then I started to seek more training in computational neuroscience.

I need to make a study plan first as there was not a plan provided by the school on computational neuroscience specifically. Listening to the suggestion from the professor of my Honor Introduction to Neuroscience, I followed a computer science major curriculum with math and neuroscience minors. That said, I took more math and neuroscience courses than the minors required, and seek online courses for complement. Some of the great courses I took are Introduction to Computational Neuroscience by Dr. Brent Doiron and Dr. Chengcheng Huang (two overlapping but complementary courses), Honor Quantitative Systems Neuroscience by Dr. Aaron Batista and Dr. Bistra Iordanova (co-instructors), Introduction to Deep Learning by Dr. Adriana Kovashka, Introduction to Machine Learning by Dr. Joseph Yurko, and Neural Plasticity by Dr. Yan Dong. If you are at Pitt, definitely take these courses!

Along with the training, I also did independent research projects related to memory and learning, vision, evolution and genetic algorithm, and olfactory navigation behaviors. Please see 'Projects' for more.

I discovered during training and research that memory, learning and perception are the most appealing fields, and I would like to apply computational methods in the exploration. However, I hold strong curiosity for things and I will keep learn and maybe try different approaches and directions, and choose the one I would like to strive for.
